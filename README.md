### Welcome to my GitHub 👋

**Jiewang** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->
- 📖 I'm a student from ZJU-UIUC Institute majoring in Computer Engineering and currently studying at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...
- ⭐️ My interests are quite diverse, spanning from prompt engineering to autonomous vehicle safety, software architecture, and wireless network analysis...
- 🔭 I'v conducted a comprehensive research on open-source software communities and effectiveness, as well as working on autonomous vehicle safety testing...
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into advanced topics like Multimodality LLM + Automated Driving
- 📫 You can reach me at: jiew5@illinois.edu 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond my love for technology, I also have a passion for coffee and art. Sipping a cup of coffee while exploring new ideas is one of my favorite ways to relax.
- ☕ New club: In ZJU, I set up a new club named "PhiloCoffee" in ZJUI. Feel free to share issue if you have any idea! https://PhiloCoffee.github.io
  
- Now, I am applying for the graduate schools in United States. Continuing my research and coursework, I want to concentrate on the possiblity of **AI agent** in **Autonomous Driving**.
