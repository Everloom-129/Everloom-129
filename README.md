### Welcome to my GitHub 👋

<!--
**Jiewang** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->
- 📖 I'm a student from ZJU-UIUC Institute majoring in Computer Engineering and currently studying at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...
- ⭐️ My interests are quite diverse, spanning from systems engineering to autonomous vehicle safety, software architecture, and wireless network analysis...
- 🔭 I’m currently conducting comprehensive research on open-source software communities and effectiveness, as well as working on autonomous vehicle safety testing...
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into advanced topics like communication networks, computer systems engineering, and mathematical software practices...
- 📫 You can reach me at: jiew5@illinois.edu 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond my love for technology, I also have a passion for coffee and art. Sipping a cup of coffee while exploring new ideas is one of my favorite ways to relax. ☕
- This summer, I will continue my research and coursework, constantly pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.
