### Welcome to my GitHub 👋

<!--
**Jiewang** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->
- 📖 I'm a student from ZJU-UIUC Institute majoring in Computer Engineering and currently studying at the University of Pennsylvania...
- ⭐️ My interests are quite diverse, spanning from vision-language model to autonomous vehicle safety, software architecture, and wireless network analysis...
- 🔭 I'v conducted a comprehensive research on open-source software communities and effectiveness, as well as working on autonomous vehicle safety testing...
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into advanced topics like Multimoda LLM + Robotics
- 📫 You can reach me at: tonyw3@seas.upenn.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond my love for technology, I also have a passion for coffee and art. Sipping a cup of coffee while appreciating literature/arts is one of my favorite ways to relax.
- ☕ New club: In ZJU, I set up a new club named "PhiloCoffee". Feel free to contact if you have any idea! https://PhiloCoffee.github.io
