Hi, I am Jie Wang(王杰), you can call me Tony. 

- 📖 I'm a master student from GRASP Lab in University of Pennsylvania.  Previously I received a dual BS in Computer Engineering at ZJU and UIUC. 
- ⭐️ My interests focused on vision-language model and robot learning. Under Prof. Dinesh's guidance, now I am a Research Assistant in the [Perception, Action, and Learning (PAL) Research Group](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/pal/index.html). 
- 🔭 I'v just finished an internship at IDEA Shenzhen, `Computer Vision & Robotics` Department, where I optimized a multi-thread vision feature extraction module by 16.7%, and I trained 6-layer transformer VLMs for video captioning. 
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into advanced topics like Multimoda LLM + Robotics. 
- 📫 You can reach me at: tonyw3@seas.upenn.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond my love for technology, I also have a passion for coffee and philosophy. Sipping a cup of coffee while appreciating literature/arts is one of my favorite ways to relax.
- ☕ My club: In ZJU, I found an NPO named "PhiloCoffee Club". Check our chill salons: [https://PhiloCoffee.github.io](https://PhiloCoffee.github.io)~
